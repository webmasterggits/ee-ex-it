	  <br> <br>
	  <b>
Since its inception in the year 2009, the Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering has been ever inclined towards creating professionals of tomorrow which can do wonders in this ever changing scenario of industrial evolution while providing cutting edge competency. 
Previously the students got admission into the Department by appearing for MPPET Exam and AIEEE Exam, which eventually led to appearing for JEE Exam on an All India Basis from the year 2014 which made an easy access gateway to students from all over India.
The students need to excel and survive in all the spheres all across the globe and so specialized trainings on MATLAB/Simulink, C/C++, PCB Design, PLC, SCADA, HMI, MiPower and Relay Logic both from experienced industry professionals and Inhouse are organized. 
It holds great importance that the students after years of study and trainings achieve their final dream destinations of holding a position for themselves in the industry. The students have been selected in reputed firms including both the Private and Public Sector enterprises, which shows that the students have well achieved their dreams and are also prospering and doing very well.
 The Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering is continuously making efforts to create such endeavors which will take the students a level up in the present scenario so that we can deliver them more than just an education so that their personality becomes complete in all aspects and flourish in all directions and reach the zenith of their life at earliest. 
The students at the end of every semester are sent to the various industrial visits so that they can practically view and learn to implement real time systems. For the purpose of which they are sent to various industries like Rani Avanti Bai Sagar (Bargi) Power House, Load Dispatch Centre, Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, BHEL,BSNL, 132kV substation , 220kV substation Nayagaon, Transformer Factory, Railway Loco Shed, etc. and many more.
